# Steps to building your own ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```bash
# Clone this repository (with American localization by me)
$ git clone https://github.com/CPLuu/cpluu.github.io.git

# or, Clone the original repository (template maintained by the original dev)
$ git clone https://github.com/Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio
```

```bash
# Go into the repository
$ cd astro-bento-portfolio
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

```bash
# Start the project in development
$ npm run dev
```

# Configuration

Remember to replace the `site` and other properties with your data in `astro.config.mjs`

# Deployment  üöÄ

Deploying your website on Netlify is optional. It's the easier method because `astro.config.mjs` contain an SSR adapter that is integrated into Netlify. GitHub Pages will not work with this template.
