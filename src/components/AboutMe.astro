      Hi, I'm Cuong, a medical student at UW Madison with a background in bioengineering from
      UC Berkeley.
      <br />
    </p>

    
    <p class="text-sm font-light margin-bottom:0">
      I aim to <em>empower</em>...
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-light margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
      <strong><em>every person with a healthy brain and mind so that each can fully self-determine!</em></strong>
    </p>
     

    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      This may be an impossible dream. Yet, I feel boundless energyâ€”learning how to best care for each of my patients, deeping my skills for translational research, and 
      serving those vulnerable in my community. I strive to mentor the next generation to do better than I can. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      That's a lot; I am learning to be more efficient. 
      When free, my friends and I take our bikes to zoom across the city, or fire up the skillet to fry some chicken katsu.
    </p>
